```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


- Take the first faceted plot in this section:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

- Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

```{r, out.width=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("plots/fig", 1:6, ".png"))

ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy))+ 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)

ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy))+ 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv),se=FALSE)

ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy,color=drv))+ 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)

ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy))+ 
  geom_point(aes(color=drv))+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)

ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy))+ 
  geom_point(aes(color=drv))+
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype=drv),se=FALSE)

ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy,fill=drv))+ 
  geom_point(color="white",shape=21,size=1.5,stroke=1)
```

- Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

- Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg (fuel consumption)?
There is a linear relationship between city and highway fuel consumption
Why is coord_fixed() important?
A fixed scale coordinate system forces a specified ratio between the physical representation of data units on the axes.
What does geom_abline() do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```

- What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()?

```{r}
#geom_pointrange
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?
```{r}
 ggplot(diamonds,aes(cut,depth))+
  geom_pointrange(stat = "summary",
                  fun.ymin = min,
                  fun.ymax = max,
                  fun.y = median)
```
- What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

- What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?

- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..,group=1))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..,group=1))
```
